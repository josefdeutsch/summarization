Grader order should mirror system fragility:

Structure

Constraints

Clustering

Intellectual quality

Stability

Never judge quality before structure.



### System Message vs User Message — Best Practice in OpenAI Evals

**System Message**

* Defines the agent’s permanent role.
* Contains rules, constraints, and output contract.
* Should not change across test cases.
* Should not contain task-specific instructions.
* Acts as the architectural “contract.”

**User Message**

* Defines the specific task instance.
* Varies across eval cases.
* Controls scope (e.g., chapter, page band, full book).
* Is what you manipulate in TDD-style testing.

### Best Practice Principle

Keep the **system message stable and minimal**.
Vary the **user message to test behavior**.

This gives you:

* Clean separation of concerns
* Better interpretability of failures
* Easier regression testing
* Scalable multi-agent design
